Completion does not work properly for page/index.mdwn links

Completion gets activated in front of \[[ text

Completion will get activated when in front of an unmatched [[, or a |, even if
they are not part of a wikilink, but of, e.g., `code segments`. This is a more 
general case of the problem above.
